My favourite recipe:
Wash the tomatoes and cut into cubes
Break the eggs and stir well; add in a little water and mix well.
Heat the oil, put in the egg first. 
Stir fry the eggs to about tender, then set aside.
Stir fry the tomatoes for a short while, add in water and salt to simmer.
When the tomatoes are a bit mushy, add in ketchup and starch water, along with the eggs, fry until ready to serve.
